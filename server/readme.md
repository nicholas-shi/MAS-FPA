# MAS-FPA Backend

## Getting Started
1. After cloning / pulling the repo, make sure to run an `npm install` in the server directory (`cd server`)
2. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with a single field:
```
mongoURI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<mongodb-cluster-id>.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
    Note: you can get the above mongoURI inside MongoDB Atlas dashboard. Navigate to your database and click on "connect." This should give you your mongoURI, from which you only need to paste in your password in the field <password>.

3. For development,run `npm run dev` inside the `server` directory. If production, run `npm run start`.

## Making Requests to the API

To interact with todos in the database, you can make requests to this API. For these examples, I will use the hostname `localhost`, as this is what you will use when testing this locally. In production, replace this with your domain/hostname.

I suggest using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/). If you use Insomnia, I have included the collection in `server/MAS-FPA.json`. You can import the collection into Insomnia by going to `Preferences > Data > Import Data > From File` and select `MAS-FPA.json`.
